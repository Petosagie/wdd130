Hello, I am Osagie Ohenhen from the ancient city of Benin, Nigeria. I am cheerful, kind, loving, eager to learn,
determined person who get on well with all kinds of people. I always love to keep a positive attitude and 
hard work doesn't bother me. I joined the church with members of my family in 1991. That is about 31 years ago,
which looks like yesterday. It is a great and exciting experience being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-Day Saints. I am married and sealed in the temple to my lovely wife. We have four wonderful children. 
The last two are twins(boys) and they are a year and five months old. They are such a joy to behold.

My major is Applied Technology and my focus is web and computer programming.  I excited to be an online student
in BYU- Idaho. I love to get additional skills and to be creative, web design gives me the opportunity to create
something that is beautiful and functional from my computer.

When I am less busy, I love watching movies especially TV series. I look forward to the release of two 
great tv series later this year  “House of the Dragons” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power”. 

Cheers
